QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING

1.  What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy?
A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. These three officers are Alexander B. Cummings, Jr., Gary P. Fayard and Bernhard Goepelt.
2.  What is the difference between holding shares as a shareowner of record and as a beneficial shareowner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company’s registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered a shareowner of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or bank, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of those shares.
3.  What different methods can I use to vote?
By Written Proxy. All shareowners of record can vote by written proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner, you may request a written proxy card or a vote instruction form from your bank or broker.
By Telephone or Internet. All shareowners of record also can vote by touchtone telephone from the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or through the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card. Beneficial owners may vote by telephone or Internet if their bank or broker makes those methods available, in which case the bank or broker will include the instructions with the proxy materials. Shareowners may also vote through the Internet via our shareowner forum located at www.theinvestornetwork.com/forum/KO. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareowners’ identities, to allow shareowners to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly.
In Person. All shareowners of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6.
4.  What shares are included on the proxy card?
If you are a shareowner of record, you will receive only one proxy card for all the shares of Common Stock you hold in certificate form, in book-entry form and in any Company benefit plan.
If you hold shares of Common Stock in any Company benefit plan and do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the administrators of the benefit plans will not vote your benefit plan shares. To allow sufficient time for voting by the administrators, your voting instructions must be received by April 20, 2012.
5.  How do I attend the meeting in person? What do I need to bring?
You need to bring documentation showing that you owned Common Stock on the record date, February 27, 2012. You also will need to bring a photo ID to gain admission. Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, cellular telephones, smartphones or other similar equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will not be allowed in the meeting room.

If you are a shareowner of record and received your proxy materials by mail, your admission ticket is attached to your proxy card. If you received your proxy materials by e-mail and voted your shares electronically via the Internet, you can print an admission ticket after you have voted by clicking on the link provided.
If you are a beneficial owner, bring the notice or voting instruction form you received from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for admission to the meeting. You also may bring your brokerage statement reflecting your ownership of Common Stock as of February 27, 2012 with you to the meeting. Please note that you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6.
6.  How can I vote at the meeting if I am a beneficial owner?
You will need to ask your broker, bank or other intermediary to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, you can follow the procedures described in the response to question 5 to gain admission to the meeting. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote your shares in advance, even if you intend to attend the meeting.
Please note that if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.
7.  If I cannot attend in person, how can I view the live webcast of the meeting?
To view the live webcast of the meeting, you can visit www.‌thecoca-colacompany.com/investors/shareowner_meeting. An archived copy of the webcast will be available until approximately June 30, 2012.

10.  What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker?
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote.

Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be included in vote totals and will not affect the outcome of the vote on any matter.

Shareowners can revoke a proxy prior to the completion of voting at the meeting by:
•
giving written notice to the Office of the Secretary of the Company;
•
delivering a later-dated proxy; or
•
voting in person at the meeting (unless you are a beneficial owner without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6).
13.  Are votes confidential? Who counts the votes?
We will continue our long-standing practice of holding the votes of all shareowners in confidence from Directors, officers and employees except:
•
as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company;
•
in the case of a contested proxy solicitation;
•
if a shareowner makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management; or
•
to allow the independent inspectors of election to certify the results of the vote.
We also will continue, as we have for many years, to retain an independent tabulator to receive and tabulate the proxies and independent inspectors of election to certify the results.

17.  How are proxies solicited and what is the cost?
We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We have engaged Georgeson Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $25,000 plus expenses. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock.
Our Directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by mail, telephone and personal contact. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities.
