QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
THE MEETING AND VOTING 

1.
What is a proxy?
        It is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our executive officers as proxies for the 2004 Annual Meeting of Share Owners. These three officers are Steven J. Heyer, Gary P. Fayard and Deval L. Patrick.

2.
What is a proxy statement?

        It is a document that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating Steven J. Heyer, Gary P. Fayard and Deval L. Patrick, each as proxies to vote on your behalf.

3.
What is the difference between a share owner of record and a share owner who holds stock in street name? 

(a)
If your shares are registered in your name, you are a share owner of record. 

(b)
If your shares are in the name of your broker or bank, your shares are held in street name. 

4.
How do you get an admission card to attend the meeting?
        If you are a share owner of record, your admission card is attached to your proxy card. You will need to bring it with you to the meeting.

        If you own shares in street name, you will need to ask your broker or bank for an admission card in the form of a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting. If you do not receive the legal proxy in time or you want to attend the meeting but not vote in person, bring your most recent brokerage statement with you to the meeting. We can use that to verify your ownership of Common Stock and admit you to the meeting; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. Please note that if you own shares in street name and you request a legal proxy any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person.

        You will also need to bring a photo ID to gain admission.

5.
How can you view the live webcast of the meeting?

(b)
By Telephone and Internet Proxy. All share owners of record also can vote by touchtone telephone from the U.S. and Canada, using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or by the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card and other enclosures. Street name holders may vote by telephone or the Internet if their bank or broker makes those methods available, in which case the bank or broker will enclose the instructions with the proxy statement. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate share owners' identities, to allow share owners to vote their shares, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. 

(c)
In Person. All share owners may vote in person at the meeting (unless they are street name holders without a legal proxy, as described in question 4). 

7.

(a)
giving written notice to the Secretary of the Company, 

(b)
delivering a later-dated proxy, or 

(c)
voting in person at the meeting. 

9.
Are votes confidential? Who counts the votes?

        We will continue our long-standing practice of holding the votes of all share owners in confidence from Directors, officers and employees except:

(a)
as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company, 

(b)
in case of a contested proxy solicitation, 

(c)
if a share owner makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his/her vote to management, or 

(d)
to allow the independent inspectors of election to certify the results of the vote.
We will also continue, as we have for many years, to retain an independent tabulator to receive and tabulate the proxies and independent inspectors of election to certify the results.
