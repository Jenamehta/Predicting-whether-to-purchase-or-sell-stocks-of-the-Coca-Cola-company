QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
THE MEETING AND VOTING 

1.    What is a proxy?

       It is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. These three officers are Gary P. Fayard, Geoffrey J. Kelly and Cynthia P. McCague.

2.    What is a proxy statement?

       It is a document that Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating Gary P. Fayard, Geoffrey J. Kelly and Cynthia P. McCague as proxies to vote on your behalf.

3.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareowner of record and as a beneficial shareowner?
       If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered a shareowner of record with respect to those shares.

       If your shares are held in a brokerage account or bank, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.

4.    How do I attend the meeting? What do I need to bring?

       You need to bring documentation showing that you owned Common Stock on the record date of February 23, 2009. If you are a shareowner of record and received your proxy materials by mail, your admission ticket is attached to your proxy card. If you received your proxy materials by e-mail and voted your shares electronically via the Internet, you can print an admission ticket after you have voted by clicking on the link provided.

       If you are a beneficial owner, bring your most recent brokerage statement with you to the meeting. We can use that to verify your ownership of Common Stock and admit you to the meeting; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 5.

       You also will need to bring a photo ID to gain admission.

       Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, cellular telephones, blackberries or other similar equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will not be allowed in the meeting room.

5.    How can I vote at the meeting if I am a beneficial owner?

       You will need to ask your broker, bank or other intermediary to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy.

       Please note that if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.

       If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, you can follow the procedures described in the response to question 4 to gain admission to the meeting. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting.

6.    What shares are included on the proxy card?

       If you are a shareowner of record you will receive only one proxy card for all the shares of Common Stock you hold:

•
in certificate form; 

•
in book-entry form; and 

•
in any Company benefit plan.
       If you hold shares of Common Stock in any Company benefit plan and do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the administrators of the benefit plans will not vote your benefit plan shares. To allow sufficient time for voting by the administrators, your voting instructions must be received by April 17, 2009.

7.    How can I view the live webcast of the meeting?

       You can view the live webcast of the meeting by logging on to our website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com and clicking on "Investors", then clicking on "Investors Webcasts", then clicking on the link to the webcast. An archived copy of the webcast will be available until May 22, 2009.

       We have included the website address for reference only. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

8.    What different methods can I use to vote?

       By Written Proxy.    All shareowners of record can vote by written proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive a written proxy card or a vote instruction form from your bank or broker.

       By Telephone or Internet.    All shareowners of record also can vote by touchtone telephone from the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or through the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card. Beneficial owners may vote by telephone or Internet if their bank or broker makes those methods available, in which case the bank or broker will enclose the instructions with the proxy materials. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareowners' identities, to allow shareowners to vote their shares, and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly.

       In Person.    All shareowners of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 5.

9.    What is the record date and what does it mean?

       The record date for the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareowners is February 23, 2009. The record date is established by the Board as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware

10.  What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares?

       Shareowners can revoke a proxy prior to the completion of voting at the meeting by:

•
giving written notice to the Office of the Secretary of the Company; 

•
delivering a later-dated proxy; or 

•
voting in person at the meeting (unless you are a beneficial owner without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 5).
11.  Are votes confidential? Who counts the votes?

       We will continue our long-standing practice of holding the votes of all shareowners in confidence from Directors, officers and employees except:

•
as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company; 

•
in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; 

•
if a shareowner makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management; or 

•
to allow the independent inspectors of election to certify the results of the vote.
       We also will continue, as we have for many years, to retain an independent tabulator to receive and tabulate the proxies and independent inspectors of election to certify the results.
