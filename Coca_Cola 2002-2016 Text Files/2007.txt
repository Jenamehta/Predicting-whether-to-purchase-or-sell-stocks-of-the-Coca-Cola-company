QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
THE MEETING AND VOTING
 
1.	What is a proxy?
It is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. These three officers are Gary P. Fayard, Geoffrey J. Kelly and Cynthia P. McCague.
 
2.	What is a proxy statement?
It is a document that Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating Gary P. Fayard, Geoffrey J. Kelly and Cynthia P. McCague as proxies to vote on your behalf.
 
3.	What is the difference between a shareowner of record and a shareowner who holds stock in street name?
If your shares are registered in your name, you are a shareowner of record.
If your shares are held in the name of your broker or bank, your shares are held in street name.
 
4.	How do I attend the meeting? What do I need to bring?
If you are a shareowner of record, your admission card is attached to your proxy card. You will need to bring it with you to the meeting.
If you own shares in street name, bring your most recent brokerage statement with you to the meeting. We can use that to verify your ownership of Common Stock and admit you to the meeting; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 5.
You also will need to bring a photo ID to gain admission.
Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, cellular telephones, blackberries or other similar equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will not be allowed in the meeting room.
 
5.	How can I vote at the meeting if I own shares in street name?
You will need to ask your broker or bank for a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy.
Please note that if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.

If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, you can follow the procedures described in the response to question 4 to gain admission to the meeting. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting.

If you hold shares of Common Stock in any Company benefit plan and do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the administrators of the benefit plans will not vote your benefit plan shares. To allow sufficient time for voting by the administrators, your voting instructions must be received by April 11, 2008.
